# Product Requirements Document: Splunk Observability Alert Management

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name & Version**: Splunk Observability Alert Management v1.0  
**Date & Status**: July 9, 2025 - Requirements Definition  
**Vision Statement**: Transform Splunk Observability alert management from manual UI workflows to declarative, version-controlled infrastructure-as-code.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points**:
- Manual alert creation through Splunk Observability UI is time-consuming and error-prone
- No version control or audit trail for alert configurations
- Difficult to maintain consistency across multiple alerts and environments
- Complex to migrate alerts between Splunk Observability organizations
- No automated validation of alert configurations before deployment
- Limited ability to review alert changes through standard code review processes

**Target User Personas**:

*Primary: Platform Engineers & SREs*
- Manage 50-200+ alerts across multiple Splunk Observability organizations
- Need consistent, repeatable alert deployment processes
- Value infrastructure-as-code principles and GitOps workflows
- Comfortable with Python, Terraform, and YAML

*Secondary: DevOps Engineers*  
- Occasional alert management as part of broader infrastructure responsibilities
- Need simple, documented processes for alert maintenance
- Prefer CLI tools over UI-based workflows

*Tertiary: Monitoring Teams*
- Responsible for large-scale alert standardization initiatives
- Need bulk operations and organizational-level alert management
- Require audit trails and change management capabilities

**Market Opportunity**: 
Splunk Observability users currently lack native infrastructure-as-code tooling for alert management, forcing them to choose between manual UI workflows or building custom automation. This gap represents a significant efficiency opportunity for organizations managing substantial alert portfolios.
